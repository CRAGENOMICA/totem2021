  experiment_description:
    Arabidopsis root longitudinal patterns.<br/>
    Data from <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5851/801.long\">Brady et al., 2007.</a><br/>
    Arabidopsis primary root was cut apart in 12 (unequal) sections,
    from columella until differentiated zone. Gene expression for
    each section quantified with ATH1 Affimetrix microarrays.<br/>
    The criteria for the identification of a section-enriched gene was
    an expression in a particular section above the 175% of average 
    expression value accross all sections (from the 50% most variable probes in the array).<br/>
    TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher&#39;s test in its enrichment function.
