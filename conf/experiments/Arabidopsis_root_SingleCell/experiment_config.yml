    Raw data from experiments were pooled a analyzed together filtering out low count genes. 
    43 different cell populations were identified by a combination of (i) Supervised analysis of markers genes from Brady et al., 2007 and from a custom list of experimentally-tested genes with tissue-specific expression and (ii) Pseudotime analysis to obtain sub-tissues in different developmental stages. Gene markers from these 43 cell populations were obtained with approaches described elsewhere.<br/>
    Colors in the image represent the enrichment value obtained for a particular tissue/cell population.<br/>
    TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher&#39;s test as enrichment function.
