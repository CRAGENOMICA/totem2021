  experiment_description:
    Sorghum bicolor inflorescence and seeds.<br/>
    Data from <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05005.x\">Davidson et al., 2012.</a><br/>
    Sorghum bicolor samples were collected from 20 days-old leaves, inflorescences before flower emergence,
    inflorescence at flower emergence, pistils and anthers while anthesis, seeds 5 and 10 days after pollination and
    embryos and endosperms from seeds 25 days after pollination. Samples were subjected to RNAseq analysis.<br/>
    The criteria for the identification of a tissue-enriched gene was
    a normalized expression in a particular tissue above the 175% of average 
    expression value accross all tissues.<br/>
    Genes with no expression were removed. <br/>
    TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher&#39;s test in its enrichment function.
