  experiment_description:
    Arabidopsis root radial patterns.<br/>
    Data from <a href=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5851/801.long>Brady et al., 2007.</a><br/>
    Different transgenic expressing tissue-specific reporters
    were separated by FACS. Repressenting non-overlaping tissues
    of the Arabidopsis thaliana root. Gene expression quantified with 
    ATH1 Affimetrix microarrays. The identification of tissue-specific 
    genes according to Brady et al., 2007 cutoffs.<br/>
    TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher&#39;s test in its enrichment function.
