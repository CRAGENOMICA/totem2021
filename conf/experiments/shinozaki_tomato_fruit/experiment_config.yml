    Solanum lycopersicum fruit development map.<br/>
    Data from <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02782-9\">Shinozaki et al., 2018.</a><br/>
    Tomato fruits spanning all ripening process from anthesis to comprete ripening were collected
    and hand-dissected or lasser-microdissected. The different tissues, at different develepment stages and
    different zones (stem, equatorial and stylar regions) were submited for RNAseq analysis.<br/>
    The criteria for the identification of a sample-enriched gene was a normalized expression in a particular 
    sample above the 175% of average normalized expression value accross all samples.<br/>
    SVG image only represents equatorial regions of tomato fruit.<br/>
    TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher&#39;s test plus Benjamini-Hochberg multiple-testing correction in this enrichment function.
